# Machine-Learning

This project was created in Binghamton's Research Immersion program. The goal is to introduce us to how Machine Learning models are trained and what are the most effective ways of analyzing data. This project also requires the ability to properly parse csv files to accomplish our goals. 

To run the programs, put all the files into one folder. Then to run Adult.py enter "python Adult.py" into the commandline and for Wine.py enter "python Wine.py" into the commandline. The results may take some time.
